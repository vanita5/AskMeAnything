Ask Me Anything
===============

Let your followers ask you anything through a simple website and a Twitter bot anonymously.

Anyone can enter a question on the website. A Twitter bot asks you the question and your reply will be visible on the website. Simple as that.

(Slightly intended as a personal ask.fm alternative)
